## Point

The thing between the cop and the gang changed much more.

The main point of this article is that Boston has seen a significant reduction in homicides, with a 50% decrease compared to the same period last year, making it on track to become the safest big city in America. The article explores the factors contributing to this improvement, challenging common explanations such as gentrification or advanced medical care. Instead, it highlights the importance of trust-building between the police and the community, which has been developed over decades through initiatives like the "Baker House" meetings. These meetings involve police, community groups, and various stakeholders working together to address crime. The text also discusses the role of "violence-interruption" groups like Roca, which work closely with the police to provide support and opportunities for at-risk youth. The success of Boston's approach suggests that a preventative criminal justice system, which offers both help and consequences, can be effective in reducing violence. The article implies that while replicating Boston's model may be difficult, it's a model worth attempting in other cities to improve public safety.
