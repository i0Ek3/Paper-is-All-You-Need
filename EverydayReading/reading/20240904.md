## Point

The core point of this article is that the banning of Elon Musk's social media platform X in Brazil raises concerns about the protection of free speech, especially in a context where even the United States is facing threats to free expression. The article suggests that if free speech is lost even in America, it could lead to the rise of tyranny.

The article also discusses the broader issue of private censorship, noting that being banned from social media does not necessarily mean a violation of free speech, as private companies have the right to set their own rules. However, the article suggests that the banning of X in Brazil is a concerning development that could have broader implications for the protection of free speech globally.
