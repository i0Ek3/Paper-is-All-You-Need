## Point

The Chinese government has been actively concealing and manipulating information about the state of the Chinese economy. Several studies have found evidence of this:

- The Chinese government has a history of concealing and distorting information about economic conditions to present a more favorable picture to higher-level officials.
- The Chinese government closely monitors and controls the flow of information, including through censorship and surveillance of the internet and media, in order to hide unfavorable economic information from the public.
- Local Chinese officials have incentives to hide economic information and performance from the central government, in order to avoid punishment or scrutiny.
- The decentralized, federalist structure of the Chinese government enables local officials to conceal economic data and performance from higher-level authorities.
- The Chinese government has a history of distorting upward reporting of economic and social grievances, in order to present a more positive picture to the leadership.

In summary, the core point seems to be that the Chinese authorities, at both the local and national levels, have been actively concealing and manipulating information about the true state of the Chinese economy, in order to maintain an appearance of strong economic performance and growth.
