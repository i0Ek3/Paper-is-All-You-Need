## Point

The core point of this article is that digital twins, which are virtual replicas of physical objects or systems, are becoming increasingly prevalent in our daily lives. The article explains that small sensors are able to gather real-time data from physical objects, which is then used to continuously update and refine the corresponding digital twins. This ensures that the digital twins accurately mirror their physical counterparts, allowing for better monitoring, analysis, and optimization of the physical systems.

The article suggests that digital twins are fast becoming a part of everyday life, as they are being applied in a wide range of industries, from manufacturing and infrastructure to healthcare and smart cities. By providing a virtual representation of the physical world, digital twins enable more efficient and effective management of complex systems, leading to improved performance, reduced costs, and enhanced decision-making.
