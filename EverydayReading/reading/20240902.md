## Point

The core point of the article appears to be that the parties in Olaf Scholz's coalition were crushed in recent state polls, and the right-wing Alternative for Germany (AfD) party has been gaining ground, campaigning in Erfurt ahead of state elections.

The article suggests that the rise of the hard-right AfD party is taking Germany into uncharted territory, as it represents a significant shift in the country's political landscape. The defeat of the parties in Scholz's coalition, which includes the Social Democrats, Greens, and Free Democrats, indicates a growing disillusionment with the mainstream political establishment and a shift towards more radical, right-wing ideologies.
