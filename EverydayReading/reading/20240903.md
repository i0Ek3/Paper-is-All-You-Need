## Point

The economic sanctions imposed by the United States and its allies on Russia in response to the Ukraine conflict have had unintended consequences, hurting Ukraine's economy and interests more than Russia's. The sanctions have disrupted trade and financial flows between Russia and Ukraine, which were closely integrated economically. This has led to significant economic damage and hardship for Ukraine, while the impact on the Russian economy has been more limited. The article likely argues that the sanctions, while intended to punish Russia, have ended up harming Ukraine more than their intended target, and that a more nuanced and targeted approach may be needed to effectively pressure Russia without unduly damaging Ukraine's interests.



## Question

What's the reason given in the past for forbidding Ukraine from using American weapons against targets in Russia?

- Against action could trigger an escalatory response from the Kremlin that would end up doing more harm to Ukraine and might even result in Russia resorting to nuclear weapons.
