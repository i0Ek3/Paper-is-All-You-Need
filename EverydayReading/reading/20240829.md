The main point of the article is to explain the simple algorithm that army ants use to collectively build bridges out of their bodies. The research reveals that the ants follow a few basic rules that lead to this complex group behavior. Specifically, the article discusses how the ants use a decentralized, self-organizing process to form these bridges, without any central coordination or planning. By following simple local rules, the ants are able to create intricate structures that serve important functions for their colony.
