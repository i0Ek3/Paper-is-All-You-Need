## Point

The main point of this article is that the historical and ongoing debate over encryption and privacy. In the 1990s, the US considered cryptographic software as munitions due to export controls, leading to legal struggles. However, the "crypto wars" eventually favored privacy advocates, and end-to-end encryption has become widespread, used globally for secure communications. Law enforcement faces challenges due to ubiquitous encryption, arguing it hinders crime detection, while privacy advocates insist on the right to private communication. The debate has evolved with technology, and today, most digital traffic is encrypted, a significant shift from a decade ago. Governments are concerned about the implications for public safety, and there are proposals for "ghost protocols" and "client-side scanning" to allow some level of surveillance without directly attacking encryption. However, experts argue that any compromise to end-to-end encryption is either unworkable or poses significant risks, and some suggest more targeted approaches rather than mass surveillance. The debate reflects a balance between security, privacy, and the potential for abuse of surveillance technologies.
