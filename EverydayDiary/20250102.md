Later today, I got my IELTS EOR and it was quite surprising and I was quite nervous at that moment. Before that, I received a WeChat notification from ShunFeng Express about the IELTS EOR. And I was so curious about it. When I came home, I got an email which was sent by IELTS and the title showed me that my EOR service had completed. I am so excited to log in to the IELTS official website to check out my result, and I got my new IELTS score which was escalated by the Speaking part. That's really amazing.
