# OmAgent: A Multi-modal Agent Framework for Complex Video Understanding with Task Divide-and-Conquer

> This markdown file created on 20240905.

## Problem

Currently, most video understanding models are limited to processing short videos, typically only a few minutes or even several seconds long.

Processing extensive videos such as 24-hour CCTV footage or full-length films presents significant challenges due to the vast data and processing demands.

## Method

We develop OmAgent, efficiently stores and retrieves relevant video frames for specific queries, preserving the detailed content of videos.

It features an Divide-and-Conquer Loop capable of autonomous reasoning, dynamically invoking APIs and tools to enhance query processing and accuracy.

The key insight of OmAgent is to replicate this process by integrating multimodal RAG and generalist AI agent.

OmAgent consists of two main components:

- A **video2RAG** video preprocessor to extract and store the generalized information from the video, akin to the foundational impression a video imprints upon the viewer’s memory.
- A Divide-and-Conquer Loop (**DnC Loop**) for task planning and execution which equipped with tool invocation capabilities.

## Conclusion

OmAgent is a powerful video comprehension agent that integrates multimodal RAG with a generalist AI agent, enabling several advanced capabilities. 

It offers a theoretical near-infinite length video understanding capacity and incorporates a secondary recall mechanism for detailed video information, which significantly mitigates information loss.

## Limitations

- LLM tends to directly use the timestamps and OmAgent cannot completely resolve it
- OmAgent fail to in precise positioning
- audio-visual asynchrony resulting in a misalignment
