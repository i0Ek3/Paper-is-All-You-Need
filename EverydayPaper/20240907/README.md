# Mini-Omni: Language Models Can Hear, Talk While Thinking in Streaming

> This markdown file created on 20240907.

## Abstract

This paper introduces the Mini-Omni, an audio-based end-to-end conversational model, capable of real-time speech interaction. 

We propose a text-instructed speech generation method, along with batch-parallel strategies during inference to further boost the performance. 

## Problems

- Complexity of Audio Reasoning
- Model Complexity
- Difficulty in Modality Alignment
- Resource Demands

## Conclution

We propose a parallel text and audio generation method that leverages minimal additional data and modules to rapidly transfer a language model’s text capabilities to the audio modality, supporting streaming output interactions with high model and data efficiency.
