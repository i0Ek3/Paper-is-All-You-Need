# FLUX that Plays Music

> This markdown file created on 20240908.

## Overview

This paper explores a simple extension of diffusion-based rectified flow Transformers for text-to-music generation, termed as FluxMusic. FluxMusic utilizes rectified flow transformers to predict mel-spectra iteratively within a latent VAE space.

Future research will investigate scalability using a mixture-of-experts architecture and distillation techniques to enhance inference efficiency.
