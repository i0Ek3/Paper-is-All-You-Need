# OmniGen: Unified Image Generation

> This markdown file created on 20240923.

## Overview

In the realm of image generation, a unified model capable of handling various tasks within a single framework remains largely unexplored. Therefore, we introduce OmniGen, a new diffusion model for unified image generation.

OmniGen is characterized by the following features: 

- Unification
- Simplicity
- Knowledge Transfer

To train a robust unified model, we construct the first large-scale unified image generation dataset X2I, which unifies various tasks into one format.
