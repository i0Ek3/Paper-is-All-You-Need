# MEMORAG: MOVING TOWARDS NEXT-GEN RAG VIA MEMORY-INSPIRED KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY

> This markdown file created on 20240912.

## Overall

The existing retrieval methods are constrained inherently, as they can only perform relevance matching between explicitly stated queries and well-formed knowledge, but unable to handle tasks involving ambiguous information needs or unstructured knowledge.

We introduce MemoRAG, a novel Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that integrates global context-awareness to address the challenges posed by complex tasks involving long input contexts.
