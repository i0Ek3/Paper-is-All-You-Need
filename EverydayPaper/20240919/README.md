# LLaMA-Omni: Seamless Speech Interaction with Large Language Models

> This markdown file created on 20240919.

## Why This One?

There is still a lack of exploration on how to build low-latency and high-quality speech interaction models based on open-source LLMs.

## Overview

We propose LLaMA-Omni, a novel model architecture designed for low-latency and high-quality speech interaction with LLMs. LLaMA-Omni integrates a pretrained speech encoder, a speech adaptor, an LLM, and a streaming speech decoder.

## Method

Check formulas mentioned in the paper.
