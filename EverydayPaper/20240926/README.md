# [StoryMaker: Towards Holistic Consistent Characters in Text-to-image Generation](https://paperswithcode.com/paper/storymaker-towards-holistic-consistent)

## Overview

We introduce StoryMaker, a personalization solution that preserves not only facial consistency but also clothing, hairstyles, and body consistency, thus facilitating the creation of a story through a series of images.

StoryMaker incorporates conditions based on face identities and cropped character images, which include clothing, hairstyles, and bodies.

## Limitations

- In the absence of an explicit pose guide, the posture of generated characters often exhibits anomalies and lacks harmony.
- Generating three or more characters simultaneously presents significant challenges.
- The fidelity and detail of the generated clothing remain unsatisfactory.
