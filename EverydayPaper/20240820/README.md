# LLexuss: an AI agent system for incident management

## Core

LLexus employs Large Language Model (LLM) agents to transform TSGs into precise, executable plans during a planning phase. 

LLexus primarily comprises of an interactive planner and an executor.

The planner aids engineers in refining TSGs into detailed plans represented as flowcharts, delineating tasks and decision points. 

The executor then autonomously carries out these plans, requiring human assistance only for tasks that require physical actions such as replacing equipment.

The system’s use of LLMs in the planning phase ensures a reduction in both LLM-related costs and the impact of potential errors in execution.

## Further Work

Perhaps an SLM could be a drop in replacement for the LLM in LLexus.

For LLexus to succeed, we still need engineers to maintain human-readable TSGs.

A TSG (troubleshooting guide) is a human-readable document that is followed by an engineer to investigate and resolve an incident.
