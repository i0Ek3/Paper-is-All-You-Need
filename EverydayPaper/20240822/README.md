# The AI Scientist: Towards Fully Automated Open-Ended Scientific Discovery

> This markdown file created on 20240822.

## Grand Challenge

Developing agents capable of conducting scientific research and discovering new knowledge.



## Core

This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models (LLMs) to perform research independently and communicate their findings. 

We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation.



## Validation

We demonstrate the versatility of this approach by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics.



## Limitations

The dataset used, from ICLR 2022, is old enough to potentially appear in the base model pre-training data - this is a hard claim to test in practice since typical publicly available LLMs do not share their training data.

And etc.



## Why does writing papers matter?

First, writing papers offers a highly interpretable method for humans to benefit from what has been learned. 

Second, reviewing written papers within the framework of existing machine learning conferences enables us to standardize evaluation.

Third, the scientific paper has been the primary medium for disseminating research findings since the dawn of modern science.
