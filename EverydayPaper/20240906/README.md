Keywords: 3D segmentation

## Abstract

We propose a preliminary exploration adapting Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM 2) for zero-shot and promptable 3D segmentation. 

SAM2POINT interprets any 3D data as a series of multi-directional videos, and leverages SAM 2 for 3D-space segmentation, without further training or 2D-3D projection, also support various prompt types.

In summary:

- Segmenting Any 3D as Videos.
- Supporting Multiple 3D Prompts. 
- Generalizable to Various Scenarios.

## Why

We identify three primary issues within previous efforts:

- Inefficient 2D-3D Projection.
- Degradation of 3D Spatial Information.
- Loss of Prompting Flexibility.
- Limited Domain Transferability.

## Words

- transferability 可转让性
- voxelization 象素化
- cumbersome 麻烦的
- isotropic 等方性
- delve into 深入
- compelling 引人注目的
