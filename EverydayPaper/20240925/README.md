# 3DTOPIA-XL: SCALING HIGH-QUALITY 3D ASSET GENERATION VIA PRIMITIVE DIFFUSION

> This markdown file created on 20240925.

## Overview

We introduce 3DTopia-XL, a scalable native 3D generative mode. It leverages a novel primitive-based 3D representation, PrimX, which encodes detailed shape, albedo, and material field into a compact tensorial format, facilitating the modeling of high-resolution geometry with PBR asset。

## Key Idea

Key idea is scaling the powerful diffusion transformer on top of a novel primitive-based 3D representation.

We propose a generative framework based on Diffusion Transformer (DiT), which comprises:

- Primitive Patch Compression
- Latent Primitive Diffusion

## Current Challengs

- optimization speed
- geometric fidelity
- lack of assets for physically based rendering (PBR)

## Words

- multifaceted 多方面的
