# DGR-MIL: Exploring Diverse Global Representation in Multiple Instance Learning for Whole Slide Image Classification

> This markdown file created on 20240911.

## Overview

We propose a novel MIL aggregation method based on diverse global representation (DGR-MIL), by modeling diversity among instances through a set of global vectors that serve as a summary of all instances.
