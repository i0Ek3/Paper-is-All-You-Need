# Strategic Chain-of-Thought: Guiding Accurate Reasoning in LLMs through Strategy Elicitation

> This markdown file created on 20240914.

## Overview

We introduce a two-stage methodology that integrates strategic knowledge, guiding the LLM to generate highquality CoT paths by first developing a problem-solving strategy and then producing the final answer.

We propose a method that leverages strategic knowledge to select and match relevant demonstrations, enabling the precise pairing of high-quality CoT examples. 

The experimental results validate the effectiveness of SCoT, demonstrating promising outcomes in reasoning tasks across multiple domains.

## Problem

CoT methods often exhibit instability due to their inability to consistently ensure the quality of generated reasoning paths, leading to suboptimal reasoning performance.

## How

To address the challenge mentioned above, we propose the Strategic Chain-of-Thought (SCoT), a novel methodology designed to refine LLM performance by integrating strategic knowledge prior to generating intermediate reasoning steps.
