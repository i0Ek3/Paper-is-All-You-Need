# OctFusion: Octree-based Diffusion Models for 3D Shape Generation

> This markdown file created on 20240902.

## Problem

How diffusion models to efficiently generate diverse and high-quality 3D shapes is still challenge.



## Opinion

We introduce OctFusion, which can generate 3D shapes with arbitrary resolutions in 2.5 seconds on a single Nvidia 4090 GPU, and the extracted meshes are guaranteed to be continuous and manifold. 



## Core

The key components of OctFusion are the octreebased latent representation and the accompanying diffusion models.
